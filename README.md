## Accessible wordle output

This is an R shiny app designed to take the input from the "Share" button on Wordle and output text and an image that is more friendly for those using screen readers than the standard Wordle output.

The app is hosted here: [https://clarehorscroft.shinyapps.io/accessible_wordle/](https://clarehorscroft.shinyapps.io/accessible_wordle/)

1) Click SHARE on Wordle
2) Paste into the text box
3) Press "Go"
4) Copy the text and the image into your social media of choice 

Note: I have only tested this on a Mac, so it's entirely possible it won't work for other people yet. This is a work in progress and was only coded in a few hours! It definitely needs more work, and I'm happy to receive any help :)
